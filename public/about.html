<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Julia. I am currently a nurse assistent. I am kind of a introvert person and perfectionist. 
  Coding give me peace and at the same time excitement to find the right solutions for particular problems. 
   </p>

<p>I took The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu on Udemy on 16th March 2024, just one week before my 36th birthday. 
  This online coding course is like more birthday investment gift for me. I hope to finish this course by the end of the year.

</p>

<p>My goal is to be a fullstack Web Developer. More than that is to be independent. 
  Freedom is not for free, it costs alot of engagemant, investment and sacrifice.
<br>See you there!
